# Data Science Portfolio

This repository collects selected data science and machine learning projects, with a focus on structured analysis, model comparison, and interpretability.

## Projects

### Explainable Insurance Purchase Prediction
- Binary classification using socio-economic and demographic data  
- Comparison of multiple model families (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting)  
- XGBoost selected as the primary model based on ROC-AUC  
- Global and local explainability using SHAP

### Subjective Wine Ratings Analysis
- Exploratory data analysis of expert wine ratings with subjective targets  
- Clustering based on numerical features (price, age, alcohol) versus categorical composition (grapes, region, producer)  
- Supervised modeling using linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosting  
- Comparison of numerical-only, categorical-only, and combined feature sets  
- Explainability with SHAP to assess global and local feature contributions  
- Case study on feature relevance, model limits, and low-signal datasets
